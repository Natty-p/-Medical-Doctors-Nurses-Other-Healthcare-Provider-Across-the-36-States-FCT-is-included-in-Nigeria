## ✅ Project Overview
This report analyzes the availability and distribution of healthcare workers (Doctors, Nurses, Pharmacists, Lab Technicians, and Community Health Workers) in relation to the total population across various states/regions in Nigeria. The aim is to evaluate healthcare accessibility based on WHO’s health worker density recommendations and to identify critical gaps.


## 📥 Data Collection
The dataset includes the following fields:
•	Total Population as of 2024
•	Basic Healthcare Facilities
•	Doctors
•	Nurses/Midwives
•	Pharmacists
•	Laboratory Scientists/Lab Technicians
•	Community Health Workers (CHWs)
•	Doctor to Population Ratio (if available or calculated)

## 📌 Data Source Assumptions:
•	Data collected from Federal ministry of health & Social Welfare on “ State of Health of the Nation 2024 Report.
•	Each row represents a geographical unit (state or region).


## 🔧 Data Processing (Excel & Power BI)
## 🧹 Data Cleaning
•	Removed missing or null values in population or workforce columns.
•	Standardized column headers and ensured all values are numeric.
•	Recalculated ratios using standard formulas.
## 📊 Data Enrichment: Calculated additional KPIs

## 🧮 Note on WHO-Based Ratio Calculations
The standard WHO approach to assessing adequacy of healthcare workforce is:
"A region is considered adequately staffed if it has at least 1 doctor and 3 nurses per 1,000 population, or 1 doctor and 1 nurses per 1,000 population.
If the above findings is correct, then the comparison should stand, if not it should be disregard. 

## 📈 Data Analysis

•	Doctor/Nurse/Pharmacist/Lab Tech/CHW per 1,000 population
•	Health Workforce per Facility

## 📍 Findings
✅ Findings Based on WHO Standards:
•	Doctor-to-Population Ratio: Most states/regions fall below the WHO minimum of 1 doctor per 1,000 population.
•	Nurse-to-Population Ratio: Only a few regions meet or exceed the 3 per 1,000 or 1 per 1,000 benchmark.
•	Pharmacists & Lab Technicians: Severely underrepresented in most states—most ratios were below 0.5 per 1,000.
•	CHWs: Distribution is inconsistent. Some regions heavily rely on CHWs; others lack them.
•	Healthcare Facilities: Many facilities are understaffed, particularly in rural areas.
•	Urban Bias: Urban areas have better workforce ratios than rural ones, suggesting inequality in healthcare access.

## Urban Bias : Urban areas have better workforce ratio than rural areas

## 📌 Limitations
•	📉 No Time Series: Analysis is cross-sectional; can't observe workforce trends over time.
•	🧾 Data Gaps: Some columns may be incomplete or contain estimates.
•	🌍 Contextual Differences: WHO standards are global; actual needs may vary by country/region.
•	🚑 Excludes Private Sector: If only public health workers are counted, results may underrepresent actual availability.
•	🧪 Lab Tech & CHWs Standards Are Not Uniform: WHO does not prescribe exact ratios for all roles.


## ✅ Recommendations
•	🩺 Recruit More Doctors & Nurses: Focus on underserved areas to meet WHO standards.
•	👩‍🔬 Train and Deploy Lab Scientists: Boost diagnostic capabilities.
•	🌍 Implement Rural Practice: Offer benefits for workers in remote locations.
•	🏥 Increase Staffing per Facility: Avoid overburdening few professionals.
•	📚 Invest in CHW Programs: Bridge gaps in rural healthcare access.
•	📈 Monitor Progress Annually: Build time-based dashboards for future analysis.

##🧾 Conclusion
The healthcare workforce in most regions falls short of the WHO recommended ratios, especially for doctors and pharmacists. This gap threatens the ability to deliver equitable and quality care. Urgent interventions are required to improve workforce density, especially in rural and underserved areas. Utilizing WHO standards for ongoing workforce assessment ensures that planning aligns with international best practices and supports better health outcomes.
